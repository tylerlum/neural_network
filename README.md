Implement Machine Learning Algorithms to Classify Data

This repository contains various Python files that demonstrate the power of machine learning. 

* `deep_neural_network.py` - Uses `Keras` to perform multi-class logistic regression

* `logistic_regression.py` - Use batch gradient descent to separate between two output types

* `multiclass.py` - Uses `Keras` to differentiate data between 5 different output classes 

* `perceptron.py` - Uses `Keras` to perform logistic regression

* `Polynomial_Regression.ipynb` - Uses polynomial regression on a sinusoidal curve
